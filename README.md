# H1B Immigration Trends Analysis

By Daniel Speer

A project for the Insight Data Science boot camp application.

# Problem

To clean and analyze the US Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Foreign Labor Certification performance data. The analysis will output the top 10 occupations and the top 10 states for certified visa applications. 

# Approach

#### Data Cleaning Assumptions:
* SOC numbers with a decimal are subsets of their XX-XXX position and counted as the 


# Run Instructions

Placer input CSV file in the `./input/` directory. CSV must use `;` as delimiter. 

The appropriate columns will be automatically collected if the following strings are included in the header. 

1. Status        => 'STATUS'
2. SOC        => 'SOC_CODE'
3. Job name    => 'SOC_NAME'
4. State        => 'WORKSITE_STATE' or 'WORKLOC1_STATE'

# Output Information

Two CSV files will be created/overwritten in the `./output/` folder.
 
* `./output/top_10_occupations.txt`
* `./output/top_10_states.txt`

# Example

Given the input file, `./input/file_name.csv` with the following data:
```
id;CASE_STATUS;YEAR_SOC;YEAR_SOC_NAME;WORKSITE_STATE
1;CERTIFIED;11-1234;DOG WALKER;WA
2;CERTIFIED;22-1234;PIRATE;CA
3;CERTIFIED;33-3333;NINJA;CA
4;CERTIFIED;11-1234;DOG WALKER;CA
```

Then the output files will be:

`./output/top_10_occupations.txt`:
```
TOP_OCCUPATIONS;NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS;PERCENTAGE
DOG WALKER;2;50.0%
NINJA;1;25.0%
PIRATE;1;25.0%
```
`./output/top_10_states.txt`:
```
TOP_STATES;NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS;PERCENTAGE
CA;3;75.0%
WA;1;25
```
# Future Improvements

* Implement threading for the data collection to allow for files larger than the available memory.
* Both of the sorting methods are almost identical. Candidate for refactoring to follow DRY practices.
